        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to instruments, I have the skill that I would say in intermediate level. I know how to play a song by ear. 
		I love to play guitar instrumentally. I can play melodies and bass lines correctly. I can also be creative when it comes to holding an organization. 
		I held an organization, doing many activities without spending too much of our funds. In playing video games, I'm good at MOBA games such as 
		League of Legends, DOTA/DOTA2, etc. I'm good at leading my team by calling the right game decisions. When it comes to managing and balancing a lifestyle, 
		I'm able to schedule the things that I like to do. I'm able to adapt with school schedules and life to be able to live happily.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hobbies are going to the gym and exercising. Usually, I work out every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. 
		I want to get healthy and fit because I'm underweight in my junior and senior high school days. I love watching basketball. I like the 
		new moves that you can use in an actual basketball game. I usually play games with my friends such as League of Legends and Valorant. 
		I play games and I go to the gym to blow off steam or to release stress. Another hobby I do is going for ocular visits when I have the opportunity. 
		I do it with my bike and I go everywhere. I love to watch highlights from any sports.</p>

        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an interest in foods, usually foods from different countries that I didn’t know. 
		I want to travel to taste those foods to try exotic dishes from different cultures. When it comes to programming languages, 
		I’m interested in Java, Python, and C#. I'm still an average programmer but I want to learn more. Another thing that I can be interested in is the art of music. 
		What interests me is the different scales of music, and how people interpret and play their music in different genres and different playing styles. Aside from that, 
		I am interested in watching horror movies or horror clips. I would say that Japanese and Thai horror movies are on a different levels of jump scare. 
		I'm also interested in cars. I like to look at how engines work. I like to read car brochures and what new features the car has.</p>
