		Agra is a city in northern India, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It is best known for the iconic Taj Mahal, one of the most famous landmarks in the world.
		The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth in 1631. It is a beautiful white marble
		mausoleum that is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, featuring intricate carvings, inlaid gems, and exquisite calligraphy. In addition to 
		the Taj Mahal, Agra is also home to several other historic landmarks, including the Agra Fort, another UNESCO World Heritage Site that dates back to the 16th century. 
		The fort is a massive complex of palaces, mosques, and courtyards, and offers stunning views of the Taj Mahal from its ramparts. Other notable attractions in Agra 
		include the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, also known as the Baby Taj, and the Mehtab Bagh, a beautiful garden that offers breathtaking views of the Taj Mahal from across 
		the Yamuna River. Agra is also known for its vibrant culture and cuisine, with a wide range of delicious dishes and street food stalls. Popular dishes include biryani, 
		kebabs, and chaat, a savory snack made with crispy fried dough and spicy toppings.

		The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, located in the western state of Gujarat, India. 
		It is the world's tallest statue, standing at a height of 182 meters (597 feet) from its base to the top of the statue. The statue was inaugurated on October 31, 2018, 
		and is located on a small island in the Narmada River, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam. The statue was built as a tribute to Patel, who is known as the "Iron Man of India" 
		for his role in unifying the country after independence from British rule in 1947. The Statue of Unity is made of bronze and is supported by a massive steel framework. 
		The statue itself is designed to resemble Patel, with his characteristic Nehru jacket and a walking stick. The base of the statue houses a museum and exhibition hall 
		that showcases Patel's life and achievements. Visitors can take an elevator to a viewing gallery located at a height of 153 meters (502 feet), which offers panoramic 
		views of the surrounding landscape. The site also includes a garden and a shopping and food court area. The construction of the Statue of Unity was a massive undertaking, 
		involving thousands of workers and engineers, and costing over $400 million. It has become a major tourist attraction in India, drawing millions of visitors from around 
		the world each year.
