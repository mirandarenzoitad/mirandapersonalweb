	<sup>4</sup>I stopped my progress in playing a guitar back in grade 7 because I don’t have the time to learn. <sup>5</sup>That time I stressed my life too much so I made a 
	difference the following year. <sup>6</sup>I decided to learn how to manage my time and it went well. <sup>7</sup>During those days while I’m learning, I tried courting, 
	I learned how to dress more cleanly and decently, I came back learning a guitar and I learned to play melodies to play it by ear. <sup>8</sup>My courtship went well but it 
	didn’t last because of other responsibilities. <sup>9</sup>I formed a band and It was the best band our school has. <sup>10</sup>We became popular because of playing popular 
	music during that time. <sup>11</sup>We are always the champions in the battle of the bands. <sup>12</sup>When it comes to academics, I was very consistent hitting the honors

	socks, took a picture of me, letters, a flower, and guitar accessories. <sup>15</sup>I would say that I’m not that handsome but I am talented and only good looking, and I

    <p><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In my college days in 1st year, 1st semester, the schedule is great because I have plenty of time to study well and to do the chores
	and also to take care of myself by going to the gym to maintain my body.</i> <q>I had no problems in 1st semester because the professors are great at teaching and I’m able to 
	sleep well because of not having too many assignments.</q> In 1st year, 2nd semester, things are a little bit draining. The schedule is going past noon, there are many things
	to note and to study. I won’t be able to do the household chores because I’m investing my time to learn. I also stopped going to the gym. Online classes hurt my eyes a lot 
	because I’m staring at the screen for long periods of time even when I’m taking my notes because it is much more efficient than pen and paper. I don’t even have the time to 
	play video games because after having a day of school sessions I eat then I study and after that, I sleep. Sometimes, when I am loaded with assignments, usually in final 
	periods where almost all subjects have many activities, I can’t even sleep without being sure that I got all the assignments done and reviewed for the quiz. Sleep is very 
	rewarding for me. College life taught me to be more responsible for my schoolwork and proper study habits to make myself productive and efficient. Organization of files, 
	folders, binders, notebooks is the key for me to be prepared. These things are hard to apply, I tried it in 2nd Year, 1st semester. <u>It will make you efficient but I’m 
	neglecting too much of my health that’s why I’m learning to adjust in every schedule that is given. I already know that if I chose to be an irregular student, I will be able 
	to breathe and control more of my time. However, doing these things by the time I will have the thesis with my groupmates, I know that we can’t work out of it due to 
	conflicting schedules. </u>The time that you’ll be only available is the time session of the thesis subject which is not enough. College life for me is hard when it comes 
	to time management, but it is okay to spend a hell of a time for 4 years  rather than to spend a lifetime suffering from having low income because of not having enough knowledge.
	Most importantly, I should enjoy the journey of my college life. Learning to have fun to make memories that I will cherish forever.
