		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <blockqoute>The Scottish Highlands are filled with astonishingly scenic glens, but Glencoe is perhaps the most famous — and infamous, 
	due to a brutal 17th-century massacre. Today the valley is a haven for hikers and mountaineers, whiskey lovers (the 19th-century Ben Nevis Distillery 
	is a short drive away), and Harry Potter fans (time it right and catch the steam train crossing nearby Glenfinnan Viaduct, used in four of the films). 
	Glencoe is perhaps Scotland’s most famous and most scenic glen. Glencoe is also arguably Scotland’s most historic glen, and it was recently voted as Scotland’s most 
	romantic glen. Glencoe is not only a holiday centre for hillwalking and mountaineering, it is also an ideal base from which to explore the Highlands of Scotland. 
	The Clachaig Guide to Glencoe Scotland provides you with information on a range of accommodation available in the area along with some ideas about the things you 
	can see and do during a holiday in Glencoe.is situated in the heart of Glencoe, and surrounded by mountains on all sides. The hotel is renowned for its warm hospitality,
