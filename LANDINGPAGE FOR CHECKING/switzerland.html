		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <blockqoute>Imagine a sparkling blue lake surrounded by mountains, a car-free medieval old town, covered bridges, 
		waterfront promenades, frescoed historic buildings, and sun-splashed plazas with bubbling fountains. No wonder Lucerne (in German, Luzern) is 
		a top spot for tourists.  Famed for its music concerts, this quintessential Swiss town lures renowned soloists, conductors, and orchestras to 
		its annual International Music Festival. The Culture and Convention Center is home to one of the world's leading concert halls.  One of the 
		city's most famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge, built in the 14th century. In a small park, lies the famous Lion Monument, a poignant 
		sculpture of a dying lion, which honors the heroic death of Swiss Guards during the attack on the Tuileries in the French Revolution. 
		History buffs will enjoy the Swiss Transport Museum with extensive exhibits on all forms of transport, including air and space travel, 
		railroad locomotives, and a Planetarium.  For beautiful views of Lucerne, the Alps, and the lake, ride the funicular to the Dietschiberg 
		on the north side of Lake Lucerne; cruise up Mt. Pilatus on the cableway; or head to the Rigi, a famous lookout point.</blockqoute></p>

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <blockqoute>In a stunning location, perched on a peninsula of the River Aare, 
		the Swiss capital of Bern exudes old-world charm, and the city's medieval old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
		Strolling along the cobbled streets, visitors can explore the tallest cathedral in Switzerland, with panoramic views 
		from its tower; 16th-century fountains; the Zytglogge medieval clock tower with moving puppets; and six kilometers of 
		shopping arcades, called "Lauben" by the locals. The Rose Garden (Rosengarten) offers beautiful views of the old town center.
		Bern has many tourist attractions waiting to be discovered, including excellent museums. Art lovers will appreciate the impressive galleries, 
		including the Zentrum Paul Klee, the world's largest collection of works by this famous artist, and the Bern Museum of Art (Kunstmuseum).

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <blockqoute> Lake Geneva, Europe's largest Alpine lake, straddles the Swiss/French border, and laps at the shores of some of 
		Switzerland's most popular cities. The city of Geneva (in French Genève; in German Genf) sits between pretty snowcapped peaks at the point where the Rhône 
		spills into Lake Geneva.This French-speaking "capital of peace" is the European seat of the United Nations and exudes a pleasing blend of French joie de 
		vivre and Swiss structure. Promenades, parks, and gardens surround the lake, and the old town is a lovely spot to stroll among the historic buildings. 
		The Jet d'Eau, a fountain in Lake Geneva shooting water 150 meters into the air, is a famous landmark. Cultural attractions include the Opera House and 
		the Grand Théâtre, which stages international acts.Also on the lake, about 62 kilometers from Geneva, Lausanne boasts lovely views over the surrounding 
		region and the lake, with the Alps rising in the distance. Take a stroll through the medieval old town with its cute cafés and boutiques and stunning 
		Gothic cathedral. At the foot of the Alps, on Lake Geneva, Montreux hosts the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival in June/July.</blockqoute></p>

	<h1 align= "center"> WHY I WANT TO VISIT THESE PLACES </h1>
	
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <blockqoute>Like other European nations, it has a unique charm of its own. 
	What makes Switzerland and its people so alluring is the combination of fantastic weather, breathtaking
	views of the Alps, and little but beautiful things like the greatest cheeses, chocolates, and timepieces.
	The chilly winter ski season is when Switzerland, known for its jaw-dropping snow-capped mountains, fantastic 
	skiing, and delectable cheese and chocolate, truly shines. Yet even if some people can't resist the allure of 
	skiing, there are just as many, if not more, reasons to visit Switzerland in the spring and summer.
	Switzerland is known for its stunning alpine scenery, with snow-capped mountains, pristine lakes, and charming 
	villages. Visitors can explore attractions like the Matterhorn, Lake Geneva, and the Jungfrau Region, which 
	offer breathtaking views of the country's natural beauty.
