		Mount Fuji is an iconic symbol of Japan and is the country's highest mountain at 3,776 meters (12,389 feet). 
		Located on Honshu Island, about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, it is an active volcano that last erupted in 1707. Mount Fuji is considered one of Japan's 
		three sacred mountains, and has been a place of spiritual significance for centuries. It is a popular destination for hikers and climbers, attracting around 
		300,000 climbers annually during the official climbing season from July to August. The mountain is known for its distinctive symmetrical cone shape, which is 
		often depicted in Japanese art and literature. It is also surrounded by several lakes and hot springs that add to its natural beauty. The climb to the summit 
		of Mount Fuji can be challenging, but it is a rewarding experience with stunning views of the surrounding landscape. There are several trails to choose from, 
		with varying degrees of difficulty. The most popular trail is the Yoshida Trail, which is also the oldest and busiest. Along the way, hikers will pass through 
		several mountain huts where they can rest and buy food and supplies. Mount Fuji is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and its unique natural and cultural significance 
		makes it one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan.
