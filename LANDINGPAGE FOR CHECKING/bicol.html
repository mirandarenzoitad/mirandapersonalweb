		is a beautifully symmetrical volcano with a steep upper slope of 35-40° and is capped by a small summit crater 200m 
		in diameter. Mayon eruptions produce lava flows, pyroclastic flows and mud flows which threaten populations at the 
		base of the volcano. Mayon Volcano is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Mayon is the main landmark and 
		highest point of Albay province and Bicol Region in the Philippines. Rocks around Mayon Volcano was aged more than 
		20 million years old. The perfect shape was formed through layers of lava flows and pyro plastic surges from erosion 
		and past eruptions. It has a small crater and the upper slopes are steep with an average of 35 to 40 degrees. Mayon has 
		the classic conical shape of a stratovolcano. It is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Since 1616, Mayon has 
		erupted 47 times. Of all the volcanoes in the Philippines, Mayon Volcano or Mount Mayon is the most iconic because of 
		its perfect cone shape. With the majestic view it offers, doing Mayon Volcano tours like the Mayon ATV activity has become 
		the main itinerary of travelers visiting the region</blockqoute></p>
